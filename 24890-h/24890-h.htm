<p>As y<sup>e</sup> ēvious Philistenes stopped y<sup>e</sup> welles of Abraham ād filled
them vpp with erth&nbsp;/ to put y<sup>e</sup> memoriall out of mīde&nbsp;/ to y<sup>e</sup> entent
y<sup>t</sup> they might chalenge y<sup>e</sup> grounde: even so the fleshly mīded
ypocrites stoppe vpp the vaynes of life which are in y<sup>e</sup> scripture&nbsp;/
w<sup>t</sup> the erth of theyr tradiciōs&nbsp;/ false similitudes &amp; lienge
allegories: &amp; y<sup>t</sup> of like zele&nbsp;/ to make y<sup>e</sup> scripture theyr awne
possessiō &amp; marchaundice: and so shutt vpp the kingdome of heven which
is Gods worde nether enterīge in thē selues nor soferinge them that
wolde.</p>

<p>&para; The scripture hath a body with out&nbsp;/ ād within a soule&nbsp;/ sprite &amp; life.
It hath w<sup>t</sup> out a barke&nbsp;/ a shell ād as it were an hard bone for y<sup>e</sup>
fleshly mynded to gnaw vppon. And within it hath pith&nbsp;/ cornell&nbsp;/ mary &amp;
all swetnesse for Gods electe which he hath chosen to geve them his
spirite&nbsp;/ &amp; to write his law &amp; y<sup>e</sup> faith of his sonne in their hertes.</p>

<p>&para; The scripture cōteyneth .iii. thīges in it first y<sup>e</sup> law to cōdemne
all flesh: secōdaryly y<sup>e</sup> Gospell&nbsp;/ y<sup>t</sup> is to saye&nbsp;/ promises of

them selues to be scolers to lern to kepe the lawe &amp; to lerne to beleue
y<sup>e</sup> mercie that is promised thē: &amp; thridly the stories &amp; liues of
those scolars&nbsp;/ both what chaunces fortuned thē&nbsp;/ &amp; also by what meanes
their scolemaster taught thē and made them perfecte&nbsp;/ &amp; how he tried the
true from the false.</p>

<p>&para; When y<sup>e</sup> ypocrites come to y<sup>e</sup> lawe&nbsp;/ they put gloses to ād make no
moare of it then of a worldly law which is satisfied with y<sup>e</sup> outwarde
worke and which a turke maye also fulfill. Whē yet Gods law never
ceaseth to cōdemne a man vntill it be written in his herte and vntill he
kepe it naturally without cōpulsion &amp; all other respecte saue only of
pure love to God and his neyboure&nbsp;/ as he naturally eateth whē he is an
hongred&nbsp;/ without cōpulsiō &amp; all other respecte&nbsp;/ saue to slake his hongre
only.</p>

<p>&para; And whē they come to the Gospell&nbsp;/ there they mīgle their leuen &amp; saye&nbsp;/
God now receaueth vs no moare to mercie&nbsp;/ but of

their captiues&nbsp;/ both in soule and body. And yet they fayne theyr Idole
y<sup>e</sup> Pope so mercifull&nbsp;/ y<sup>t</sup> if thou make a litle money glister in
his Balams eyes&nbsp;/ there is nether penaunce ner purgatory ner any fastīge
at all but to fle to heven as swefte as a thought and at the
twinkellynge of an eye.</p>

<p>&para; And the liues stories and gestes of men which are cōtayned in the

And one y<sup>e</sup> chefest &amp; fleshliest studie they have&nbsp;/ is to magnifie
y<sup>e</sup> sayntes aboue measure &amp; aboue y<sup>e</sup> trueth &amp; with their poetrie to
make them greater then euer God make them. And if they finde any
infirmite or synne asscribed vn to y<sup>e</sup> saintes&nbsp;/ that they excuse with

thē: even as a man wold obtayne y<sup>e</sup> fauoure of wordely tirantes: as
they also fayne the saintes moch moare cruell then ever was any heathē
man &amp; moare wrekefull and vengeable then y<sup>e</sup> poetes faine their godes
or their furies y<sup>t</sup> torment y<sup>e</sup> soules in hell&nbsp;/ if theyr euēs be
not fasted &amp; their images visited &amp; saluted wyth a Pater noster (whych

that y<sup>e</sup> fulfillynge of y<sup>e</sup> law is&nbsp;/ a fast fayth in
christes bloud coupled w<sup>t</sup> our professiō &amp; submyttīge our selues to
lerne to doo better.</p>

<p>&para; And of y<sup>e</sup> Gospell or promises which thou metest in y<sup>e</sup> scripture&nbsp;/
beleue fast y<sup>t</sup> God will fulfill them vn to y<sup>e</sup>&nbsp;/ and that vn to
y<sup>e</sup> vttemost Iott&nbsp;/ at the repentaunce of thyne herte&nbsp;/ whē thou turnest
to hym &amp; forsakest euell&nbsp;/ even of his goodnesse &amp; fatherly mercie vn to
the&nbsp;/ ād not for thy flatterīge hym with ypocritish workes of thyne awne
fayninge. So y<sup>t</sup> a fast faith only with out respecte of all workes&nbsp;/
is the forgeuenesse both of the synne which we did in tyme of ignoraunce
with luste ād cōsent to synne&nbsp;/ &amp; also of all the synne which we doo by
chaunce &amp; of frailte&nbsp;/ after y<sup>t</sup> we are come to knowlege ād have
professed y<sup>e</sup> law out of oure hertes. And all dedes serue only for to
helpe oure neyboures &amp; to tame oure flesh that we fall not to synne
agayne&nbsp;/ &amp; to exercice oure soules
<span class="pagebreak" title="7">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>
in vertue&nbsp;/ &amp; not to make satisfaction
to Godward for y<sup>e</sup> synne y<sup>t</sup> is once paste.</p>

<p>&para; And all other stories of y<sup>e</sup> bible&nbsp;/ with out excepciō&nbsp;/ are y<sup>e</sup>
practisinge of y<sup>e</sup> law &amp; of the Gospell&nbsp;/ and are true and faitfull
ensamples &amp; sure erneste y<sup>t</sup> God will euen so deale with vs&nbsp;/ as he
did with thē&nbsp;/ in all infirmities&nbsp;/ in all temptaciōs&nbsp;/ &amp; in all like cases
&amp; chaunces. Wherin ye se on y<sup>e</sup> one syde&nbsp;/ how fatherly &amp; tendirly &amp;
with all cōpassion god entreateth his electe which submitte them selues
as scolers&nbsp;/ to lerne to walke in the wayes of his lawes&nbsp;/ &amp; to kepe thē
of loue. If they forgatt thē selues at a time &amp; wēt astraye&nbsp;/ he sought
thē out &amp; sett thē agayne with all mercie. If they fell &amp; hurte thē
selues&nbsp;/ he healed thē agayne with all compassion &amp; tendernesse of hert.
He hath ofte brought greate tribulation &amp; aduersite vppon his electe:
but all of fatherly loue only&nbsp;/ to teach thē &amp; to make them se their awne
hertes &amp; y<sup>e</sup> sinne y<sup>t</sup> there laye hid&nbsp;/ that they might aftirwarde
feale his mercie. For his mercie wayted vppon thē&nbsp;/ to rid them out
agayne&nbsp;/ assone as they ware lerned &amp; come
<span class="pagebreak" title="8">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>
<span class="pagesig" title="A.v.">&nbsp;</span><a name="Sig_A5" id="Sig_A5"></a>
to y<sup>e</sup> knowlege of their
awne hertes: so that he neuer cast man awaye how depe so euer he had
sinned&nbsp;/ saue thē ōly which had first cast y<sup>e</sup> yocke of his lawes frō
their neckes&nbsp;/ with vtter diffiaunce &amp; malice of herte.</p>

<p>Which ensamples how cōfortable are they for vs&nbsp;/ whē we be fallen in to
sinne &amp; God is come vppō vs with a scorge&nbsp;/ y<sup>t</sup> we dispeare not&nbsp;/ but
repēt with full hope of mercie after y<sup>e</sup> ensamples of mercie y<sup>t</sup>
are gone before: And therfore they were written for our lernīge&nbsp;/ as
testifieth Paul Ro. xv. to cōforte vs&nbsp;/ y<sup>t</sup> we might y<sup>e</sup> better put
oure hope &amp; trust in God&nbsp;/ whē we se&nbsp;/ how mercifull he hath bene in tymes
past vn to our weake brethern y<sup>t</sup> are gone before&nbsp;/ in all theyr
aduersities&nbsp;/ neade&nbsp;/ temptaciōs&nbsp;/ ye &amp; horrible synnes in to which they
now &amp; then fell.</p>

<p>&para; And on y<sup>e</sup> other side ye se how they y<sup>t</sup> hardened their hertes &amp;
synned of malice &amp; refused mercie y<sup>t</sup> was offered thē &amp; had no power
to repēt&nbsp;/ perished at y<sup>e</sup> later ende with all confusion &amp; shame
mercilessely. Which ensamples are very good &amp; necessary&nbsp;/ to kepe vs in
awe &amp; dreade in tyme of prosperite

as thou maist se by Paul. j. Cor. x.
that we abyde in the feare of God&nbsp;/ &amp; wax not wild and fall to vanities
ād so synne ād prouoke God and bringe wrath vppon vs.</p>

<p>&para; And thridly ye se in that practise&nbsp;/ how as god is mercifull &amp;
longesoferynge&nbsp;/ euen so were all his true prophetes &amp; prechers&nbsp;/ beringe
the infirmities of their weake brethern &amp; their awne wrōges &amp; iniuries
with all paciēce &amp; longesoferinge&nbsp;/ neuer castinge any of thē of their

to him ād as the word of god y<sup>e</sup> only fode ād life of thy soule&nbsp;/ this
marke &amp; note. First count Ionas the frend of god ād a man chosen of god
to testifie his name vn to y<sup>e</sup> worlde: but yet a younge scolar&nbsp;/ weake
&amp; rude&nbsp;/ after y<sup>e</sup> faciō of y<sup>e</sup> appostles&nbsp;/ while Christ was yet with
them bodyly. Which though Christ taught thē euer to be meke &amp; to vmble
thē selues&nbsp;/ yet oft stroue amonge them selues who shuld be greatest. The
sonnes of Zebede wold sitt&nbsp;/ the one on the right hōde of Christ ād the
other on y<sup>e</sup> lifte. They wold praye&nbsp;/ that fire might descēde from
heuen&nbsp;/ and consume the Samaritanes.</p>

<p>&para; Whē Christ axed who saye men that I am&nbsp;/ Peter answered&nbsp;/ thou arte the
sonne
<span class="pagebreak" title="11">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
of the lyuinge God&nbsp;/ as though Peter had bene as perfecte as an
angell. But immediatly after&nbsp;/ when Christ preached vn to thē of his
deeth &amp; passiō&nbsp;/ Peter was angre &amp; rebuked Christe &amp; thought ernestly
y<sup>t</sup> he had raued &amp; not wist what he sayde: as at a nother time&nbsp;/ when
Christ was so feruētly busied in healinge y<sup>e</sup> people&nbsp;/ y<sup>t</sup> he had
not leyser to eate&nbsp;/ they went out to holde him&nbsp;/ supposinge that he had
bene besyde him selfe. Ande one y<sup>t</sup> cast out deuels in Christes name&nbsp;/
they forbade&nbsp;/ because he wayted not on them&nbsp;/ so glorious were they yet.</p>

<p>&para; And though christ taughte all waye to forgeue&nbsp;/ yet peter after longe
goenge to scole&nbsp;/ axed wether men shuld forgeue .vij. tymes&nbsp;/ thynkinge
y<sup>t</sup> .viij. tymes had bene to moch. And at y<sup>e</sup> last soper Peter wold
have died with christe&nbsp;/ but yet within fewe howres after&nbsp;/ he denied hym&nbsp;/
both cowardly &amp; shamefully. And after y<sup>e</sup> same maner&nbsp;/ though he had so
lōge herd that nomā might auenge him selfe&nbsp;/ but rather turne y<sup>e</sup> other
cheke to&nbsp;/ then to smyte agayne&nbsp;/ yet when Christ was in takīge&nbsp;/ peter
axed whether

it were lawfull to smyte with y<sup>e</sup> swerde&nbsp;/ ād taried none
answere&nbsp;/ but layed on rashly. So that though when we come first vn to
y<sup>e</sup> knowlege of the trueth&nbsp;/ and the peace is made betwene God &amp; vs&nbsp;/ &amp;
we loue his lawes &amp; beleue &amp; trust in hym&nbsp;/ as in oure father &amp; haue good
hertes vn to him &amp; be born anew in y<sup>e</sup> sprite: yet we are but childern
ād younge scolars weake &amp;

&amp; must have leysar to grow in y<sup>e</sup>

<p>&para; And God oure father &amp; scolemaster fedeth vs &amp; teached vs accordinge vn
to the capacite of oure stomakes&nbsp;/ &amp; maketh vs to grow &amp; waxe perfecte&nbsp;/ &amp;
fineth vs &amp; trieth vs as gold&nbsp;/ in y<sup>e</sup> fire of temptaciōs &amp;

knew of&nbsp;/ to teach y<sup>e</sup> that a mā liueth not by bred

promises of god are life vn to all y<sup>t</sup> cleaue vn to thē&nbsp;/ moch moare
thē is bred &amp; bodyly sustinaunce: as y<sup>e</sup> iourney of y<sup>e</sup> childern of
Israel out of egypte in to y<sup>e</sup> londe promised them&nbsp;/ ministreth the
notable ensamples &amp; y<sup>t</sup> aboundātly&nbsp;/ as doeth all y<sup>e</sup> rest of the
bible also. How be it&nbsp;/ it is impossible for flesh to beleue &amp; to trust
in y<sup>e</sup> trueth of gods promises&nbsp;/ vntyll he haue lerned it in moch
tribulacion&nbsp;/ after that God hath deliuered hī out therof agayne.</p>

<p>&para; God therfore to teach Ionas &amp; to shew him his awne hert &amp; to make him
perfecte &amp; to enstructe vs also bi his ensample&nbsp;/ sent him out of y<sup>e</sup>
lande of Israel where he was a prophete&nbsp;/ to goo amonge y<sup>e</sup> heathē
people &amp; to y<sup>e</sup> greatest &amp; mightiest citie of y<sup>e</sup> world thē&nbsp;/ called
Niniue: to preache y<sup>t</sup> within .xl. dayes they shuld all perish for
their sinnes &amp; that y<sup>e</sup> citie shuld be ouerthrowē. Which message y<sup>e</sup>
frewil of Ionas had as moch power to doo&nbsp;/ as the weakest herted womā in
the world hath power&nbsp;/ if she were cōmaunded&nbsp;/
<span class="pagebreak" title="14">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
to leppe in to a tobbe of
lyuinge snakes &amp; edders: as happely if God had cōmaunded Sara to haue
sacrificed hir sonne Isaac&nbsp;/ as he did Abrahā&nbsp;/ she wold haue disputed
with hī yer she had done it&nbsp;/ or though she were strōge ynough&nbsp;/ yet many
an holy seint coud not haue found in their hertes&nbsp;/ but wold haue
disobeyed ād haue runne awaye frō y<sup>e</sup> presens of y<sup>e</sup> cōmaūdemēt of
god w<sup>t</sup> Ionas if thei had bene so strōgly tēpted.</p>

<p>&para; For Ionas thought of this maner: loo&nbsp;/ I am here a prophete vn to Gods
people the Israelites. Which though they haue gods word testified vn to
them dayly&nbsp;/ yet dispice it &amp; worshepe God vnder y<sup>e</sup> likenesse of
calues &amp; after all maner facions saue after his awne worde&nbsp;/ &amp; therfore
are of all naciōs y<sup>e</sup> worst &amp; most worthy of punishment. And yet god
for loue of few y<sup>t</sup> are amonge them &amp; for his names sake spareth them
&amp; defendeth them. How thē shuld god take so cruell vengeaunce on so
greate a multitude of them to whome his name was neuer preached to ād
therfore are not y<sup>e</sup> tenth parte so euel as these? If I shal therfore
goo preach
<span class="pagebreak" title="15">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
so shall I lye &amp; shame my selfe &amp; God therto and make them
the moare to dispice god and sett the lesse by him ād to be the moare
cruell vn to his people.</p>

<p>&para; And vppon that imaginaciō he fled frō the face or presens of God: that
is&nbsp;/ out of y<sup>e</sup> contre where God was worsheped in &amp; frō prosecutynge of
Gods cōmaundemēt&nbsp;/ and thought&nbsp;/ I wyll gett me a nother waye amonge y<sup>e</sup>
hethen people &amp; be no moare a prophete&nbsp;/ but lyue at rest &amp; out of all
cōbraunce. Neuer y<sup>e</sup> lesse the god of all mercie which careth for his
electe childern &amp; turneth all vn to good to them &amp; smiteth thē to heale
them agayne &amp; killeth thē to make thē aliue agayne&nbsp;/ &amp; playeth with thē
(as a father doth some tyme with his yoūge ignoraunt childern) &amp;
tempteth them &amp; proueth them to make them se theyr awne hertes&nbsp;/ prouided
for Ionas&nbsp;/ how all thinge shuld be.</p>

my flesh be a lett vn to youre faythes&nbsp;/ ye shall yet then be with out

vppō you. And so Christe came agayne after y<sup>e</sup> resurrecciō&nbsp;/ in his
spirite &amp; preached repētaunce vn to them&nbsp;/ by the mouth of his appostles

gaye agenst the receauinge agayne of y<sup>e</sup> weked spirite that bringeth
.vii. worse then hym selfe with him &amp; maketh y<sup>e</sup> later ende worse then

to a wyldernesse in respecte of that it was before.</p>

<p>&para; And now Christ to preach repētaunce&nbsp;/ is resen yet ōce agayne out of
his sepulchre in which the pope had buried him and kepte him downe with
his pilars and polaxes and all disgysinges of ypocrisie&nbsp;/ with gyle&nbsp;/
wiles and falshed&nbsp;/ ād with the swerd of al princes which he had blynded
with his false marchaundice. And as I dowte not of y<sup>e</sup> ensamples that

turne it backe agayne and cease it.</p>

<p>&para; When Ionas had bene in

which went ouer hys hert&nbsp;/ halfe ouercome&nbsp;/
<span class="pagebreak" title="23">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
he prayed&nbsp;/ as he maketh
menciō in the texte sayēge: Ionas prayed vn to the lord his god out of
the bely of the fishe. But the wordes of that prayer are not here sett.
The prayer y<sup>t</sup> here stondeth in the texte&nbsp;/ is the prayer of prayse &amp;
thākesgeuēge which he prayed and wrote when he was escaped and past all
ieopardie.</p>

<p>&para; In the end of which prayer he sayth&nbsp;/ I will sacrifice with the voyce
of thankesgeuenge and paye that I haue vowed&nbsp;/ that sauinge cometh of the
lorde. For verely to cōfesse out of the herte&nbsp;/ that all benefites come
of God&nbsp;/ euen out of the goodnesse of his mercie and not deseruinge of
oure dedes&nbsp;/ is the only sacrifice that pleaseth God. And to beleue that
god only is the sauer&nbsp;/ is the thynge that all the Iewes vowed in theyr
circumcision&nbsp;/ as we in oure baptim. Which vowe Ionas now tawght with
experiēce&nbsp;/ promiseth to paye. For those outwarde sacrifices of bestes&nbsp;/
vn to which Ionas had haply asscribed to moch before&nbsp;/ were but feble &amp;
childish thinges &amp; not ordeyned&nbsp;/ that the workes of thē selues shuld be

vn to god&nbsp;/ but vn to the people&nbsp;/ to put thē in remembraunce
of this inwarde sacrifice of thankes &amp; of faith to trust and beleue in
God the only sauer. Which significacion when was awaye&nbsp;/ they were
abhominable and deuellysh ydolatrye and imageseruice: as oure ceremonies
and sacramentes are become now to all that trust &amp; beleue in the werke
of them and ar not taught the significacions&nbsp;/ to edifye theyr soules
with knowlege and the doctrine of God.</p>

<p>&para; When Ionas was cast vppō lond agayne&nbsp;/ then his will was fre ād had
power to goo whother God sent him &amp; to doo what God bade&nbsp;/ his awne
imaginacions layed a parte. For he had bene at a new scole&nbsp;/ ye ād in a
fornace where he was purged of moch refuse &amp; droshe of fleshly wisdome&nbsp;/
which resisted y<sup>e</sup> wisdome of god &amp; led Ionases wil cōtrary vn to
y<sup>e</sup> will of god. For as ferre as we be blynd in Adam&nbsp;/ we can not but
seke &amp; will oure awne profitt&nbsp;/ pleasure &amp; glorie. And as ferre as we be
taughte in the sprite&nbsp;/ we can not but seke &amp; wyll the pleasure and

vn to the discreciō of other men. But I thinke that it was then the
greatest citie of the world.</p>

<p>&para; And that Ionas wēt a dayes iourney in the citie&nbsp;/ I suppose he did it
not in one daye: but wēt fayre &amp; easyly preachīge here a sermon &amp; there
a nother &amp; rebuked the synne of the people for which they must perishe.</p>

<p>&para; And when thou art come vn to the repētaunce of the Niniuites&nbsp;/ there
hast thou sure ernest&nbsp;/ that how soeuer angre god be&nbsp;/ yet he remembreth
mercie vn to all that truly repent and beleue in mercie. Which ensample
oure sauioure Christ also casteth in the teeth of the indurat Iewes
sayenge: the Niniuites shall rise in iudgemēt with this nation and
condemne them&nbsp;/ for they repented at the preachynge of Ionas&nbsp;/ and beholde
a greater thē Ionas here&nbsp;/ meanynge of hym selfe. At whose preachinge

<span class="pagebreak" title="26">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
Iewes coude not repent: when the
heathen Niniuites repented at the bare preachynge of Ionas rebukinge
theyr synnes with out any miracle at all.</p>

<p>&para; Why? for y<sup>e</sup> Iewes had
<a name="c_26" id="c_26"></a>
<a href="#cn_26" class="correction" title="possible error for 'leuēed'">leuēded</a>
the spirituall law of God and with
theyr gloses had made it all to gether erthie ād fleshly&nbsp;/ and so had
sett a vayle or coueringe on Moses face&nbsp;/ to shodowe and darken y<sup>e</sup>
glorious brightnesse of his contenaunce. It was synne to stele: but to
robbe wedowes howses vnder a coloure of longe prayēge&nbsp;/ &amp; to polle in the
name of offeringes&nbsp;/ and to snare y<sup>e</sup> people with intollerable
cōstitucions agēst all loue&nbsp;/ to ketch theyr money out of theyr purses&nbsp;/
was no synne at all.</p>

<p>&para; To smyte father ād mother was synn: But to withdraw helpe frō them at
theyr nede&nbsp;/ for blynde zele of offeringe&nbsp;/ vn to the profytt of the holy
phareses&nbsp;/ was then as meritorious as it is now to let all thy kynne
chose wheter they will synke or sweme&nbsp;/ while thou byldest and makest
goodly fundatiōs for holy people which thou hast chosen to be thy

them selues from theyr couetousnesse&nbsp;/ pryde&nbsp;/ lechury or any vyce that
thou seyst amonge the laye people.</p>

<p>&para; It was greate synne for Christ to heale the people on the sabboth daye
vn to the glorie of God hys father&nbsp;/ but none at all for them to helpe
theyr catell vnto theyr awne profett.</p>

<p>&para; It was synne to eate wyth vnwashen handes or on an vnwashen table&nbsp;/ or
out of an vnwashen dish: but to eate out of that purifyed dysh that
which came of brybery&nbsp;/ theft &amp; extorsion&nbsp;/ was no synne at all.</p>

<p>&para; It was exceadynge meritorious to make many dyscyples: But to teach
them to feare God in hys ordynaunces&nbsp;/ had they no care at all.</p>

<p>&para; The hye prelates so defended the ryght of holy church ād so feared the
people with

in soch estymacion and reuerēce&nbsp;/ that it was moch greater synne to
sweare truly by them&nbsp;/ thē to forswere thy selfe by God: what vengeaunce

they to fall on thē that had stolen soch holy thīges? And yet sayth
Christ&nbsp;/ that ryghtwesnesse ād faith in kepynge promise&nbsp;/ mercie and
indyfferent iudgement were vtturly troden vnder fote and cleane dispysed
of those blessed fathers&nbsp;/ whych so mightely mayntened Arons patrimony ād
had mad it so prosperous ād enuironed it and walled it aboute on euery
syde with y<sup>e</sup> feare of god&nbsp;/ that noman durst twech it.</p>

<p>&para; It was greate holynesse to garnysh y<sup>e</sup> sepulchres of y<sup>e</sup> prophetes
&amp; to cōdemne their awne fathers for sleynge of them: and yet were they
thē selues for blinde zele of their awne cōstituciōs&nbsp;/ as ready as their

to sle whosoeuer testified vn to them&nbsp;/ the same trueth which
the prophetes testified vn to theyr fathers. So that Christ cōpareth all
the rightwesnesse of those holy patriarkes vn to the outwarde bewtye of
a paynted sepulchre full of stench and all vn clennesse wythyn.</p>

<p>&para; And finally to begyld a mans neyboure in sotle bargeninge and to
wrappe and cōpase him in with cauteles of the law&nbsp;/ was then as it is now
in the kingdome of y<sup>e</sup> Pope. By the reason where of they excluded the
law of loue out of theyr hertes&nbsp;/ ād cōsequētly all true repentaunce: for
how coude they repēt of y<sup>t</sup> they coude not se to be sinne?</p>

<p>&para; And on the other syde they had sett vpp a rightwesnesse of holy
workes&nbsp;/ to clense theyr soules with all: as the Pope sanctifieth vs with
holy oyle&nbsp;/ holy bred&nbsp;/ holy salt&nbsp;/ holy candels&nbsp;/ holy dome ceremonies ād
holy dome blessynges&nbsp;/ and with what soever holynesse thou wilt saue with

hir by y<sup>e</sup> waye of repentaunce vn to y<sup>e</sup> fountayne of Christes
bloude to washe it awaye thorow faith. By the reason of which false
rightwesnesse they were dysobedient vn to the rightwesnesse of God&nbsp;/
which is the forgeuenesse of synne in Christes bloude and coude not
beleue it. And so thorow fleshly interpretynge the law ād false imagined
rightwesnesse&nbsp;/ their hertes were hardened ād made as stony as clay in an

<p>&para; And in the last ende of all&nbsp;/ thou hast yet a goodly ensample of
